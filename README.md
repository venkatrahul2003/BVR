# Canteen Database Management 
We created a Canteen Database Management Project.In which the user can order the food items in the canteen easily using our proposed website.
To run the project download the index,rinf html files and respective css files .
We store the user entered data into our localhost php my admin server.We established a connection between
Front end and Backend using Php.The Canteen members can have access to retrieve the information
about user.Similarly the user can see the bill generated by our website.
